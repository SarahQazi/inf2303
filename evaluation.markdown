# Course Structure

This course will be taught as a seminar except for the first two classes which will be lecture format.
While the instructor will at times present material to complement the
  readings, much of the time will be spent discussing and analyzing
  the readings.
Students are expected to take responsibility for their learning of the
  material through active engagement with the assigned readings,
  through participation in course discussion, and through their
  individual work on a research paper.

# Deliverables and Evaluation

Grades will be based on the following components:

•	Presentation on an open source project: 25%
•	Seminar discussion lead: 20% (2 X 10% each)
•	Term Paper: 35%
•	Course Patch: 10%
•	Participation: 10%

Assignment 1: Presentation on an open source project or product

In groups of 4-5 students will select an open source project for detailed study and analysis and present their findings in a 20 minute presentation in class.
Students will research and select an open source project or software and provide an overview of it including its history, founders, uses, purpose, and targeted audience. Students should also provide examples of major decision making in the life of the project or product, as well as challenges, controversies and successes. 
The purpose of this assignment is for students to gain deeper insight into open source projects and software by examining actual OS projects or products. This assignment will provide students a chance to connect the theoretical knowledge gained in the course to an real life OS software or project. 

Assignment 2: Seminar Discussion Lead

Students will be required to lead a seminar discussion 2 times in the course. Students will sign up for classes they wish to lead during the first class. 
2-3 students will be expected to lead the discussion during each class. Students will present a summary and critique of the readings and ask 2 discussion questions. Each student will summarize a different reading for that day. For example if there are 3 readings assigned and 3 students leading that day—each student will be responsible for a different reading and 2 discussion questions. Students will take turns presenting the summaries and leading the discussions in the class.  
Seminar presentations will be graded for quality of the summary, analysis, and critique of the readings presented and the aptitude of the discussion questions to spark discussion. 

Assignment 3 Term Paper

Students will write an 8-10 page paper exploring a specific topic related to the content of the course.
This will be an individual assignment. 

Students can pick paper topics that best align with their professional
  interests, as long as there is a clear relationship to the topics
  discussed in the course and as long as the topic is discussed in
  appropriate depth.
Here are some examples of appropriate topics:

* A paper analysing available free / open source software for
  libraries and making an argument for or against use of such software
  over proprietary solutions.
* A paper exploring the history of a particular F/OSS product to
  challenge some of the common assumptions about how such projects
  work.
* A paper looking at information management practices in a F/OSS
  project, pointing to ways such practices could be applied in other
  domains or suggesting improvements.
* A paper analyzing peer production of a particular kind of digital
  goods other than software.

<i>The list above is meant to exemplify appropriate topics and is not
  exhaustive.</i>

Due to the short duration of the course, students should start working
  on their papers <span class="important">very early</span>, ideally
  not later than the second week of the course.


### A Course “Patch” — 10%

Each student will be asked to submit a “patch” (modification) to the
  course.
The “source files” for the course syllabus are available on Github at
  <https://github.com/yuri/inf2303>.
The patches will be submitted via Github, which will include the
  actual modification and a brief summary.
Additionally, a one-page justification should be submitted via email.
